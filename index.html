				<div class="quotes-box">A lot of people give up just before theyre about to make it. You know you never know when that next obstacle is going to be the last one. Through perseverance many
					people win success out of what seemed destined to be certain failure. Let yourself be silently drawn by the stronger pull of what you really love. If only wed stop trying to be happy wed
					have a pretty good time. Dreams come true. Without that possibility, nature would not incite us to have them. It can't be spring if your heart is filled with past failures. Never tell a
					young person that anything cannot be done. God may have been waiting centuries for someone ignorant enough of the impossible to do that very thing.
